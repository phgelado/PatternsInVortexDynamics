# PatternsInVortexDynamics

This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks that use Python and Data Science for fluid mechanics, specially in the study of vortex dynamics: processing FTLE files, plotting, data processing, Gamma-1 criterion, and the Q-Criterion.

This work carried during my masters thesis in fulfillment of the requirements MEng Aeronautical Engineering degree at the University of Glasgow, for the Applied Fluids Research Group led by Dr Kiran Ramesh.
