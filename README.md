# PatternsInVortexDynamics

This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks that use Python and Data Science for fluid mechanics, specially in the study of vortex dynamics: processing FTLE files, plotting, data processing, Gamma-1 criterion, and the Q-Criterion.

Github sometimes has some trouble rendering Jupyter Notebooks, if that's the case, try refreshing your page a few times and that should do the trick. Alternatively, download and clone the repo onto your machine. 

This work carried during my masters thesis in fulfillment of the requirements MEng Aeronautical Engineering degree at the University of Glasgow, for the Applied Fluids Research Group led by Dr Kiran Ramesh.
